## 💻 Usage Guide (Windows Focus)

These WireGuard configuration files (`.conf`) are optimized for seamless use in a Windows environment.

### 📌 Recommended Tool for Optimal Performance (Windows)

For the best performance, stability, and compatibility on Windows, it is **highly recommended** to use the following client instead of the official WireGuard application:

* **Wiresock VPN Client (Recommended)**
    * **Link:** [https://www.wiresock.net](https://www.wiresock.net)

Wiresock is a robust client that supports the WireGuard protocol, offering superior performance in connection management and traffic handling on Windows systems.
